The Balloon Seller

The RedCliffe International School is known for its lavish Cultural and Sports day Celebrations. To attract the kids a balloon seller was selling balloons. There were balloons of two different colours(red and violet). If one balloon is sold, he inflates two balloons of the other colour.
 
Suppose he has 'x' red balloons and 'y' violet. From that he sold a balloon and inflated two of the other color and then a second balloon is sold. Calculate:
The probability that the second balloon sold is violet.
The probability that both balloons sold are of the same color.

Write a program to find the desired data.
