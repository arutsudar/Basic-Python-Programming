Square Point

Given the side of the square and the cooordinates of the left bottom vertex of the square, find whether a point P1(x,y) lies within (or on) the square or not.
 
 
Input Format:
The first line of the input is an integer which corresponds to side length of the square.
The second line of the input is an integer which corresponds to x coordinate of the left bottom corner point.
The third line of the input is an integer which corresponds to y coordinate of the left bottom corner point.
The fourth line of the input is an integer which corresponds to x coordinate of the point P1.
The fifth line of the input is an integer which corresponds to y coordinate of the point P1.
 
Output Format:
Output is a String. Print "Yes" if P1 lies inside or on the square, else print "No".
