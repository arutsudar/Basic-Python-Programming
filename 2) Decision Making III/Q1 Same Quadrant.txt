Same Quadrant
 
Given 2 points in a 2-D plane, find whether the 2 points lie in the same quadrant.
 
Input Format:
The first line of the input is an integer which corresponds to x coordinate of the first point.
The second line of the input is an integer which corresponds to y coordinate of the first point.
The third line of the input is an integer which corresponds to x coordinate of the second point.
The fourth line of the input is an integer which corresponds to y coordinate of the second point.
 
Output Format:
Output is a String. Print "Yes" if both the points lie on the same quadrant, else print "No".
