Final Year Project Teams
David is the Advisor for the Final Year Instrumentation Engineering batch of students at St.Xavier's Academy. Final year Project presentation is the vital part in any student's College arena. David was illustrating his students on many interesting projects he had presented and is now involved in splitting the class into multiple 'r'-member teams so that each team works and presents one project.
