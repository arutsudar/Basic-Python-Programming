Sequence of Numbers
According to Wikipedia, an arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression whose common difference is a non-zero integer.

On the other hand, a geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, . . . is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. But again for this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer.

Given 'n' successive members of a sequence, you need to determine the type of the progression and the next successive member otherwise print "Neither GP nor AP". 

Input   Format   
The first line consists of integer value which represent the number of members in the sequence.
The next 'n' line consists of integer which represents the respective members in the sequence.

Output   Format  
Output should print the type of the progression as "AP" or "GP" followed by the next successive value in the sequence separated by a space.
Otherwise print "Neither GP nor AP".
