Shooting Game
The Summer Fair was inaugurated in the City with many entertaining events and interesting shows. There was a shooting game at the Fair which attracted more attention among the people. The shooting game comprised of 4 quadrants with many target points. Aim of the game is that the player to shoot all the target points within the given 'n' number of chances. Everytime the player shoots a target point, the digital board near the shooting grid displayed the position of the target on the 2D-plane, whether they lie on x-axis or y-axis or 1st quadrant or 2nd quadrant or 3rd quadrant or 4th quadrant.

So, help the event coordinators to print the quadrants of the target points, when the player shoots the point. Write a program with a given set of points in a 2-D Plane, classify them as whether they lie on the x-axis or y-axis or 1st quadrant or 2nd quadrant or 3rd quadrant or 4th quadrant. 

Input   Format   
The first line consists of integer value the corresponds to 'n', the number of target points on the shooting grid.
The next '2*n' lines consists of integer values, in which the first line is the x-coordinate of the first point, second line corresponds to y-coordinate of the first point, and so on..

Output   Format  
The Output consists of n lines, in which each line is a string which represents the axis or quadrant on which each of the target point lies.
