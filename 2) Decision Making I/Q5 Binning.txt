Binning

Rambo Circus is a famous Circus show which has been put up as a Summer Treat for the Kids in the City. Naina accompanied to the show with her parents on an evening and she was utmost delighted to witness a Circus show for the first time ever.

What interested Naina more at the show were the Jokers who made the audience burst out in laughter. One other Joker in the group was entertaining the audience by playing the 'Binning' game, wherein he picked a ball randomly everytime from a big pool of balls and targeted it to the baskets nearby. The balls which the Joker picks are numbered between 10 - 50 (both inclusive). Based on the number on the balls he pick, he would pocket them to the baskets as below:

Ball is numbered from 21 to 30 -- Basket 2
