Kho Kho Match
Sundar is the Physical Education Teacher at a reputed school in the City. An Interschool Kho-Kho tournament is to be played shortly and Sundar was involved in training the School Kho-Kho team with sprinting, dodging, diving and taping practices. Once the practices were over, he intended to conduct warm-up matches to ensure the fitness levels of the students.

The primary thing about the game is that the players should be seated at proper positions on the Centre line between the two poles. Ramesh, a spectator of the match wanted to confirm this but mathematically. Write a program to check if a player is exactly on the Centre line, given (x1,y1), (x2,y2) are co-ordinates of the two poles and (x3,y3) is the player location.

Input Format:
The first line of the input corresponds to two integers (x1,y1).
The second line of the input corresponds to two integers (x2,y2).
The third line of the input corresponds to two integers (x3,y3). 
 



Output Format:
Output should print a string "In position" (without the quotes) if the player is standing on the Centre line. Otherwise print "Not in position"(without the quotes).
