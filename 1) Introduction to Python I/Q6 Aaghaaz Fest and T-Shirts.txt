"Aaghaaz" Fest and T-Shirts

In the "Aaghaaz" Fest, all the events are divided into 2 categories: Technical Events and Non Technical Events. The Fest was overpeopled, the reason why the event organizers had difficulties to identify and guide the participants to their desired genre of events. However the organizers planned to distribute T-shirts of 2 colors Red and Yellow to differentiate the participants. The Red color is for students participating in Technical events and Yellow color is for students participating in Non Technical events.
