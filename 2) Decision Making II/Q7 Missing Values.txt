Missing Values

Aryan is a Data Mining expert, who is a specialist in filling missing data. He was once approached by the Auditing Staff of a software company "Yoho". The Staff had a report of vital but out dated Tax bills of the company, in which 3 tax values were missing and requested Aryan's help in finding the missing values.

Aryan is given with 3 tax values and this is how he fills in the missing data:
If there is a missing value, it will be indicated by a -1.
If all the 3 data values are available, he gives the data values as such.
If one of the 3 data values is missing, he fills the missing value with the mean of the 2 known values.
If two of the 3 values are missing, he fills the missing values with the available value.
If all the 3 values are missing, he tell that the data cannot be recovered.

Aryan was busy in another priority task and has asked you to intervene. Write a program to fill in the missing values.

Input Format:
Input consists of three integers which corresponds to the data values.

Output Format:
