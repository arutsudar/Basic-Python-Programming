RBI policy

The new RBI policy with respect to ATM usages would be applicable effectively from April 1st, which will curtail free ATM usages.

As per the policy, which was released earlier, users can use the ATMs of their home bank only for 3 times a month beyond which 1% per transaction would be charged. Incase they use the ATMs of other banks 2% per transaction would be charged for cash withdrawals.

Consider a user has used the ATM 5 times in a month. Based on the bank and amount withdrawn, write a program to find the service charge.

Input Format:
The first line of the input is a string which tells the user's home bank.
 The remaining five lines consists of two inputs, first one is a string which tells from which bank's ATM the amount was drawn and the second one is an integer which tells you the amount drawn.

Output Format :
Output should print an integer value which gives the service charge.
[Note: Assume that the Output will always be an Integer.]
Refer sample input and output for further formatting specifications.
